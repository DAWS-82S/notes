Monitoring
==============
Whitebox monitoring --> we know the internal details of the systems. metrics, data points, errors, traffic, etc...
Blackbox monitoring --> as an end user checking the systems are working fine or not

4 golden signals of monitoring

Latency --> time to get response --> less latency is preferred
Traffic --> number of requests to our system
Errors --> Especially 500 errors
Saturation --> resources of servers should be measured

Time Series Database
====================
timestamp, value of that metric at that timestamp

Quarterly, half yearly, yearly, weekly, daily
