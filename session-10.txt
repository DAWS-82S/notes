git repos --> Storing code

1. creation of repo
2. clone repo to our laptop
git clone https://github.com/daws-78s/shell-script/blob/main/06-array.sh
3. we develop code
4. select some editor. vscode editor. visual studio code editor. free editor
5. add code to staging area

git add <file-name>
git add . --> all files will be added to staging area

6. commit to local repo

git commit -m "message"

7. git push oigin main

SVN --> Sub version control --> Centralised

Centralised vs Decentralised

easy to collapse if at one place

Decentralised --> Distributed economy, if one collpase no problem to country

Version Control
================
History of changes
Need to maintain multiple versions --> I need to track the changes --> Why I changed? When I changed? Who changed?

20-DEC-2024 We deployed app in prodction
21-DEC-2024 there is issue

19-DEC-2024 --> restore to this version

Colloboration


.sh --> shell script extension

C shell, K Shell, Z Shell, Shell --> Bash

#!/bin/bash, #/bin/sh

Shebang --> It should be the first line of shell script. It is the interpreter to execute the commands  and syntax inside shell script

which ls
/bin/ls

sh <script-name>
bash <script-name>

variables
================
lets take x=1, y=0

derive the formual
finally submit values

a centralise place to mention the values, if you change at one place, it will reflect at all the places where it is referred

DRY == Don't repeat yourself

1. variables
2. data types
3. conditions
4. loops
5. functions

arguements or args --> run time variables -> no need to edit script
