plain server --> app runtime(nodejs), create user, create app folder, download the code, install dependencies, create systemctl services, start the application

check user has root access or not
store logs
try to use colors

install mysql server
enable it
start it
set the root password

idempotency --> even you run any number of times, it should not change the result

HTTP GET --> idempotent
HTTP POST --> chance of duplicates or errors, we need to handle this in programming
HTTP PUT --> no problem, but we can say it is already updated
HTTP DELETE --> chance of error, resource not found. Handle this in scripting/programming

deployment --> updating new version

remove old code
download new code
install dependencies
restart the server --> stop and start

delete old logs in linux server
-------------------------------
14 days log files --> will be in server
archive and move to storage servers

delete files older than 14 days from now
only delete .log files
