When new project comes
DevOps team will have meeting with dev team.. we explain our pipeline features, branching strategy, etc.
We onboard them into tools
	Jenkins
	Kubernetes
	GitHub Scans
	Infra creation using terraform ECR repos
	Repos creation and settings
	Webhook setup
We are following jenkins shared library, pipelines are ready they just need to keep one pipeline code max of 15lines that will enable our pipelines automatically. Pipelines will be cloned at run time and will run CICD automatically.
