Master and Agent/Node architecture
---------------------------------
java, nodejs python, reactjs

1acre
100 acres --> he should have employees/resources

only master can't handle multiple builds at a time
every project needs different runtime environments and different versions. master can't handle all these things, we will have multiple agents specialised for different environments

host IP, username and password

declarative vs scripted
-------------------------

scripted --> it is groovy based pipeline from jenkins beginning
declarative --> jenkins-2.0 launched declarative pipeline using groovy

scripted --> pipeline is compiled at the time of runtime
declarative --> entire pipeline is compiled first and then run

declarative pipeline --> standard/easy syntax
scripted --> dynamic groovy syntax, little tough but we can control pipeline with lot of flexibility

we use hybrid for more advantages

webhooks
-----------
when developer push the code, it should automatically trigger CI pipeline

github --> event driven --> jenkins
