I recently developed a backup script for our linux servers. I installed the script in /usr/local/bin and tested in the server. It worked well. So I configured it into crontab. But next day morning when I come to office I checked it is failed..

/home/ec2-user/.local/bin:
/home/ec2-user/bin:
/usr/local/bin: --> Customised commands
/usr/bin: --> System commands for normal user
/usr/local/sbin: --> Customised super user commands
/usr/sbin --> System super user commands

/bin --> softlink to /usr/bin.. So keep the commands in /usr/bin

hash -r --> reload the path cache

/usr/bin:/bin

crontab environment is minimal, it is not the same environment as when I run manual

1. monitor linux servers disk usage, send an email if any disk is using more than 80%

from email, to email

How do you run other scripts from current shell script?
sh <script-name> it runs in seperate process, cant access variables of script1

source ./script-name

2nd script executes in the process of script-1. so we can access script2 variables also
